<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

I'm Oksana. I am a front-end developer from Belarus. I have learned HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Figma, Gsap, Git. 
And now Iâ€™m looking for a job where I can put my skills into practice, where I can become part of a team and benefit the company. 
I try to learn something new every day and now I am learning React.


After a hard day at work, it is very important to restore your strength. 
For this purpose, I created this project so that you can relax with the sounds of nature.

Here you can hear:
* Sounds of a fire
* Sounds of the night forest
* Dolphin sounds
* Sounds of crickets

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
